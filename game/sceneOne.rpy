    "Yeah.{w=0.75} Torture."
    "A princess you may be, but you certainly aren't a fan of bureaucracy in any form."
    "You know that you have to know this, but that doesn't make it any easier to sit through, especially when the advisors have it out for you"
    "'Too precocious,{w=0.75} too reckless,{w=0.75} too masculine.{w=0.75}' You could repeat him word for word. They're all stuffy and ridiculous, leftovers from your parent's time ruling that they handed over to you"
    "As soon as you're able, you plan to fire them."
    "You're grateful to your parents,{w=0.75} you are! But the world is getting bigger and brighter, and these advisors are definitely stuck in the past. It's unbearable to listen to, but you only have to deal with it until you turn twenty one."
    "Succeeding the throne has never looked so appealing."
    "And it's not all bad. The fact that your knight is waiting just outside the door makes everything slightly more bearable. As soon as you're safely within the walls of your room, you both are going to complain up a storm."
    "Muse has only been your personal guard for three years, but she's ambitious and smart. She makes silly faces with you when you walk the halls between meetings, and doesn't even tell your mother and father when you climb trees and fall wrong."
    "She's great, really."
    "With how she acts, honestly you'd think she was the princess."
    "She's got more decorum than you do, though that never bothered you, and she dresses like she grabbed all her outfits from your mother's closet as a young adult. People who are coming in from outside the castle often mix up who's supposed to be who."
    "It's a wonder she hasn't—{nw=3.25}"

    "There's a scuffle outside the hallway, something quick and muffled."
    "You wouldn't usually worry—{w=0.75} Muse is super duper competent!—{w=0.75} but then she lets out a muffled swear."
    #HERE is where you would change the scene im unsure if they want this to be offscreen or on screen so ill ask about it
    Muse "FUCK— LET ME GO!" with sshake
    "Muse {i}never{/i} swears."
    "She thinks it's improper for a lady of her knightlyness to do such a thing. The last time she swore was when you almost fell off the low part of the castle roof."
    "You get up, despite shouts to stay put."
    Advisor "My lady, please stay seated while the danger is dealt with!"

    "But by the time you get out to the hallway, advisors close behind you, Muse is gone. All that's left of her is a scrap of her dress and a note."
    "The handwriting looks ridiculous."
    "'I have taken your very lovely princess! We are to be wed at dawn in three days time, and then I will be king of your kingdom! You're invited to the wedding if you can make it in time. Toodles!'"
    "There is so much wrong with that letter. Starting with the written out addition of 'toodles'."
    "And yeah Muse is lovely, but she's not you! You're a very pretty princess. You're almost insulted."
    "Almost, because the idea of being called lovely by this guy gives you major creeps."
    "You feel—{w=0.75} helpless. You're not used to being on this side of the kidnapping!{w=0.75} You're used to being the damsel, not the one waiting patiently for the damsel to be returned safely."
    "You don't know how your family does it, even if it's basically routine. The idea of Muse being in this stupid guy's clutches makes you itchy and frantic."
    "A realization hits. You can't sit still while Muse is dealing with a creep that's trying to marry her! If she's the princess this time, then you'll just have to be the knight."
    Advisor "Princess Calliope, what are you doing?!"
    "You run past him with a grin."

    Cal "I'm going to save my knight!"
    "He sputters out denials, but you ignore him with the ease of lots of practice. You almost head straight for the armory, but pivot midway."

    "You knock heavily at Harper's door. Harper, your best friend since the wet nurse, opens the door, sees the look on your face, and immediately attempts to slam it shut."
    "You're well used to that, so you jam your foot in the door and lean against it."
    Cal "Harper, my good friend!"

    Harper "What do you want."
    "Harper has a glare mean enough to kill weeds, but really she's kind of a loser once you get past that."
    "She can barely stand to even look at horses. She finds them too freaky."
    "Her wimpiness is part of her charm though, and you're well used to her complete aversion to any and all of your plans."
    "You're good at completely bulldozing her over until she doesn't even know how she got on a roof with you!"
    Cal "Muse got kidnapped, so I'm going to go save her!"
    "Concern takes over Harper's face for a moment."
    Harper "Muse got kidnapped? Why?"
    "You wave a hand dismissively."

    Cal "I know how to fight, and you're my moral support. C'mon, where's your sense of adventure?"

    Cal "With that attitude yeah! Have some confidence. It's all about your mindset."
    "Harper mumbles something to herself. You dutifully pretend you can't hear how many ancient curses she's hissing at you."
    "There's a give and take to friendship. You give Harper heart attacks, and ignore when she dabbles in dark magic. It's an exchange!"
    "The armory is empty at this time of day. No doubt all the knights have been called into a strategy meeting to get Muse back, so you have access to your favorite gear."
    "Suiting up makes you feel like a proper knight. With a sword in hand, you feel confident in your ability to get Muse back from that creepy kidnapper."
